**Subject:** Rollout timeline &amp; pilot for Jamie

Hi Will,

Thanks again for the demo last week – the team really liked how Jamie stayed out of the way until we needed a doc.

As discussed, we&#39;re keen to explore a **small pilot** with our sales and customer success teams.

A couple of questions:
- What would a realistic **start date** look like if we sign off next week?
- Can we start with **one squad (6–8 users)** before rolling out more widely?

Thanks,
Alex

Hey Alex,

Great to hear the team enjoyed it!

If we receive sign-off next week, we can comfortably
- kick off **implementation in late Feb**, and
- start a **3-month pilot in early Q2** (first or second week of April).

Starting with one 6–8 person squad is exactly how we recommend rolling out Jamie. We&#39;ll work with you to:
- connect your core tools (Google Workspace, Zoom/Meet), and
- configure a few **pitch decks / pricing sheets / email templates** Jamie should prioritise for your team.

I&#39;ve attached a short **Pilot Plan** as a PDF with milestones and responsibilities.

Best,
Will

Hi Will,

This looks good.

Early Q2 for the pilot works on our side. Internally we&#39;re aiming to have approvals wrapped up by **next Friday**, so assume we&#39;re on track unless you hear otherwise.

One small question from our IT team: during calls, does Jamie **store full transcripts** or just key snippets / metadata? They&#39;re fine either way, they just want to understand the model.

Cheers,
Alex

Hey Alex,

Great – I&#39;ll tentatively pencil in **early April** for pilot start.

On data storage:
- By default, Jamie stores **meeting transcripts and structured metadata** (participants, duration, key entities like &quot;pricing&quot;, &quot;timeline&quot;, etc.).
- For the pilot, we can optionally switch to **snippet-only retention** where Jamie keeps only the small segments tied to retrieved documents.

We&#39;ll walk your IT team through this in a short **security &amp; data** call – I&#39;ve dropped a one-pager into the same shared folder as the pilot plan.

Thanks again,
Will

Thanks Will,

That answers the IT questions.

Assume we&#39;re good for **early Q2 pilot**. Once I get the final green light, I&#39;ll send you the list of users for the first squad.

Talk soon,
Alex
