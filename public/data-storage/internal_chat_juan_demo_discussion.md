# Internal Chat – Juan & Will (Free Demo for Alex)

**Channel:** #sales-jamie  
**Context:** Discussing free pilot/demo structure for Alex’s team

**Juan – 9:06 AM**  
Morning! Just watched the recording from your call with Alex. They seem like a great fit.

**Will – 9:07 AM**  
Yeah, super engaged. Their sales + CS squads are exactly our target. I’m thinking we sweeten the deal with a small **free demo period**.

**Juan – 9:08 AM**  
Agree. What are you thinking… 2 weeks? 1 month? We don’t want to get stuck in a never-ending free trial.

**Will – 9:10 AM**  
My thought: **3-week structured demo** for a single squad (6–8 users).
- Week 1: setup + onboarding
- Week 2: “real” client meetings with Jamie in the background
- Week 3: review + decision

We frame it as a “guided pilot” rather than a trial.

**Juan – 9:12 AM**  
I like the structure. Maybe we position it as **"complimentary implementation + 3-week guided demo"** if they commit to a paid plan afterwards?

**Will – 9:14 AM**  
Exactly. Something like: 
> “If this works for your team, we roll straight into the **Growth plan** post-demo, no extra setup fee.”

That way we’re signalling this isn’t just free forever.

**Juan – 9:16 AM**  
Cool. What about success criteria? We should define 2–3 simple metrics:
- X% of meetings where Jamie retrieves at least one doc
- Team feedback score
- Time saved / tab switching reduction (even if it’s anecdotal)

**Will – 9:18 AM**  
👍 Good call. I’ll suggest:
1. Jamie is used in **at least 10 client calls** during the demo.
2. **4/5 average rating** from the squad on “does this make meetings smoother?”
3. They agree on a **go / no-go decision** by the end of Week 3.

**Juan – 9:20 AM**  
Perfect. Also: make sure we mention our **data handling** upfront. Alex’s IT team sounded cautious.

**Will – 9:22 AM**  
Yep, I’ll bundle it like this:
- 3-week guided demo for one squad
- No implementation fee
- Option for **snippet-only retention** during the demo
- If they move ahead, we flip to full transcript storage (if they want) + roll them onto **Growth** at $399/mo.

**Juan – 9:24 AM**  
Love it. Very “low-friction, high signal.”

**Will – 9:25 AM**  
Cool, I’ll email Alex today and pitch it as a **“3-week Jamie test drive”**. If they’re keen, we can schedule onboarding in late Feb.

**Juan – 9:26 AM**  
Nice. Tag me when you send it – happy to join the onboarding call and walk through best practices.

**Will – 9:27 AM**  
Will do. This could be a great reference case if it lands.
